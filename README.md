# Project description
As an evolution of [Project 2](https://github.com/hedcler/udacity-dataengineer-project2) Sparkify has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud.

Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I was tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

**1. Design and create schemas**
